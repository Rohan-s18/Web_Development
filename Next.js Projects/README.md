# Next.js Projects
## Authors: Rohan Singh 

This directory is for all of the Next.js projects thatwe will be working on. Next.js is a web-dev framework that gives server-side rendering for React-based web applications. Before looking at any of these projects, **make sure that you are comfortable working with React.js**, otherwise you might be completely lost. We have also created a repository for the basics of React.js in this repository, so feel free to check that out to refresh yourself with or learn React.js  

The Projects inside this folder include:  
    - **intro project:** This project contains the very basics of Next.js, through this you can learn how to use React components within a next.js web application. This project is oriented more towards the front-end aspect of Next.js. The intro-project just demonstrates how to create applications using nextjs.    
    - **cwru-courses:** This is a more advanced full-stack web application for course scheduling at cwru.
