# Next.js Projects
## Authors: Rohan Singh and Alessandra Puccio

This directory is for all of the Next.js projects that Rohan and Alessandra will be working on. Next.js is a web-dev framework that gives server-side rendering for React-based web applications. Before looking at any of these projects, **make sure that you are comfortable working with React.js**, otherwise you might be completely lost. We have also created a repository for the basics of React.js in this repository, so feel free to check that out to refresh yourself with or learn React.js


For any suggestions, please feel free to contact us.
