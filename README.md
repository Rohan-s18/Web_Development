# Web_Development
## Authors: Rohan Singh and Alessandra Puccio

This repository is for some personal web development projects. Source code contains HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap and Node.js, the repository also contains multimedia which we have used in certain web pages as well. The goal of this repository is to track our web development process and benchmark everything that we have been learning.

Under this repository there are multiple source code folders:
1) Simple Stuff: Extremely basic HTML/CSS and JavaScript code, which should be able to cover the simple topics of all of the three.  

2) Intermediate JS: This contains slightly more intermediate JavaScript code, doesn't contain a lot of sparkly webpages. Most of the work here includes:      
    - Checking the different Output formats.  
    - Using different data types.  
    - Using Arrays and traversing through them.  
    - Using Objects.  
    - Calling functions and making them slightly more complex.  

3) Bootstrap: Diving into Bootstrap to make the webpages style component loook better.
