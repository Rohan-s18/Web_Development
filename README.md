# Web_Development
## Author: Rohan Singh  

This repository is for my personal web development projects. Source code contains HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap and Node.js, the repository also contains multimedia which I have used in certain web pages as well. The goal of this repository is to track my web development process and benchmark everything that I have been learning.

Under this repository there are multiple source code folders:
1) Simple Stuff: Extremely basic HTML/CSS and JavaScript code, which should be able to cover the simple topics of all of the three.  

2) Intermediate JS: This contains slightly more intermediate JavaScript code, doesn't contain a lot of sparkly webpages. Most of the work here includes:      
    - Checking the different Output formats.  
    - Using different data types.  
    - Using Arrays and traversing through them.  
    - Using Objects.  
    - Calling functions and making them slightly more complex.  

3) Bootstrap: Diving into Bootstrap to make the webpages style component loook better.
