# Web Development
## Authors: Rohan Singh and Alessandra Puccio

This is a web development repository made up of web development projects ranging from the basics of web development to more advanced web applications. The Source code contains HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Node.js, the repository also contains multimedia which we have used in certain web pages as well. The goal of this repository is to track our web development process and benchmark everything that we have been learning.

Under this repository there are multiple source code folders:  

1) Simple Stuff: Extremely basic HTML/CSS and JavaScript code, which should be able to cover the basic concepts of all of the three.  

2) Intermediate JS: This contains slightly more intermediate JavaScript code, doesn't contain a lot of sparkly webpages. Most of the work here includes:      
    - Checking the different Output formats.  
    - Using different data types.  
    - Using Arrays and traversing through them.  
    - Using Objects.  
    - Calling functions and making them slightly more complex.  

3) React Basics: Diving into the basics of React.js  

Future projects will include:  
    - Django  
    - Bootstrap  
    - Flask  

This repository is maintained by Alessandra Puccio and Rohan Singh :)
