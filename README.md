# Web Development
## Authors: Rohan Singh and Alessandra Puccio

This is a web development repository made up of web development projects ranging from the basics of web development to more advanced web applications. The Source code contains HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Node.js, the repository also contains multimedia which we have used in certain web pages as well. The goal of this repository is to track our web development process and benchmark everything that we have been learning.

Under this repository there are multiple source code folders:  

1) **Simple Stuff:** Extremely basic HTML/CSS and JavaScript code, which should be able to cover the basic concepts of all of the three.  

2) **Intermediate JS:** This contains slightly more intermediate JavaScript code, doesn't contain a lot of sparkly webpages. Most of the work here includes:       
    - Checking the different Output formats.  
    - Using different data types.  
    - Using Arrays and traversing through them.  
    - Using Objects.  
    - Calling functions and making them slightly more complex.  

3) **React Basics:** Diving into the basics of React.js. this directory includes the following:  
    - **Tic Tac Toe game:** just a simple program using react js, has simple classes and rendering.  
    - **Static Course Selection Page:** slightly more advanced react project, which can be used by people for course selection.  
    - **Dynamic Course Selection Page:** Built on the previous react project, but with db connection which would make it easier to check course selection.  
4) **Next.js Basics:** Making Full Stack web-applications using Next.js, this directory includes:  
    - **Cwru-Courses:** A dynamic web appllication that can be used to view different CWRU courses, this web application is connected to MongoDB schemas.  

Future projects will include:  
    - Django  
    - Bootstrap  
    - Flask
