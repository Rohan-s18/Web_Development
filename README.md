# Web_Development
## Author: Rohan Singh
This repository is for my personal web development projects. Source code contains HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap and Node.js, the repository also contains multimedia which I have used in certain web pages as well. The goal of this repository is to track my web development process and benchmark everything that I have been learning.

Under this repository there are multiple source code folders:
1) Simple Stuff: Extremely basic HTML/CSS and JavaScript code, which should be able to cover the simple topics of all of the three.
2) Intermediate JS: This contains slightly more intermediate JavaScript code, doesn't contain a lot of sparkly webpages.
3) Bootstrap: Diving into Bootstrap to make the webpages style component loook better.
